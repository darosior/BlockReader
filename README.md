# BlockReader
BlockReader is a simple C++ reader(/parser) for Bitcoin binaries blk*.dat. You can store the output to a file (to specify as the last optionnal argument).  
The standard output displays more (meaningless) details.  
Usage : ./bin "directory which contains binaries" "nb of blocks to read" ("output file")  
  
A data folder is provided with some sample blocks (the 2 firsts).  
The "test.txt" is the result output from the data directory.
